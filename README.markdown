# Rube is a Ruby-based RPG

This code is fresh, barely functional, and very messy. It's nothing more than an attempt to hone my Ruby skills with a fun, little project. Perhaps I'll end up with something half-playable after all (Yeah right!).

Simply execute rube to play. (Make sure it's executable; you may need to *chmod a+x rube*.)
